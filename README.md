# 🤖 TBL — Tele Bot Lang

> The scripting language made for Telegram bots —  
> fast to learn, fun to write, and surprisingly powerful.

---

## 🚀 The Vibe

No semicolons.  
No `npm install`.  
No thousand-line bot skeletons.

Just you and a dream.  
And maybe a few buttons.  
_(Okay, a lot of buttons. Because buttons are life.)_

## 🛠️ Want to Hack More?

TBL is made for:

- Lazy devs who prefer coffee over typing ☕  
- Busy devs who hate rewriting the same code 5 times 🔄  
- Curious tinkerers who want results *like yesterday* ⏳

No judgment here. We’ve all been there.

## ⚡ Why TBL?

- 🧠 **Readable AF** — even your sleep-deprived brain will say “Yeah, I get this” 😴  
- ⏱️ **90% sync, 10% async** — mostly fast and straightforward, with a sprinkle of magic when waiting is unavoidable ✨  
- 🔧 **Built-in powers** — from timers to variables, buttons to API calls, all packed in and ready to roll ⚙️  
- 🧩 **Expandable** — want to go wild? TBL’s got your back 🦸‍♂️  
- 🚫 **No boilerplate** — kiss goodbye to endless `client.on("message")` nightmares 👋

---

## ✨ Why TBL?

Because building bots should be fun, not a full-time job.

TBL lets you write what you *mean*, not how you *compile*.

It’s simple, powerful, and just cheeky enough to keep things interesting.

## 🎯 Who’s This For?

- Developers who want to launch bots *yesterday* 🚀  
- Creators who hate boilerplate like the plague 🧟‍♂️  
- Anyone who believes bots should do the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to 💪

Your bot’s next adventure starts here.
