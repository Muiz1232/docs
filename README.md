# 🤖 TBL — Tele Bot Lang

Welcome to **TBL (Tele Bot Lang)** — the scripting language made for Telegram bots, designed to get you up and running fast, without all the usual headaches.

---

## 🚀 The Vibe

No semicolons.  
No `npm install`.  
No thousand-line bot skeletons.  

Just you and a dream.  
And maybe a few buttons.  
(Okay, a lot of buttons. Because buttons are life.)

## 🛠️ Want to Hack More?

TBL is made for:

- Lazy devs who prefer coffee over typing  
- Busy devs who hate rewriting the same code 5 times  
- Curious tinkerers who want to see results *like yesterday*  

No judgment here. We’ve all been there.

## ⚡ Why TBL?

- 🧠 **Readable AF** — even your sleep-deprived brain will say “Yeah, I get this”  
- ⏱️ **90% sync, 10% async** — mostly fast and straightforward, with a sprinkle of magic when waiting is unavoidable  
- 🔧 **Built-in powers** — from timers to variables, buttons to API calls, all packed in and ready to roll  
- 🧩 **Expandable** — want to go wild? TBL’s got your back  
- 🚫 **No boilerplate** — kiss goodbye to endless `client.on("message")` nightmares

## ✨ Why TBL?

Because building bots should be fun, not a full-time job.

TBL lets you write what you *mean*, not how you *compile*.  

It’s simple, powerful, and just cheeky enough to keep things interesting.
